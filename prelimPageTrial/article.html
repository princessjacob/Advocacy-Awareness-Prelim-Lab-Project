                    <p>Education is as important as making sure of the fact that you are living to this very day. Take the novel Animal Farm by George Orwell for example, wherein the animals had tried their best to be as educated as possible. However, being someone not used to it or being overly naïve enough to simply follow those who are educated made their lives worse for the turn. Their ignorance had led them to only suffer despite the fact that they should have been living in comfort after suffering from slavery for long.
                    <br>
                    <br> A fair proof as to why education is important. A fair proof as to why education should be for all. No one should think that just because someone bests them when it comes to genius that they no longer need education. No one should think that because they are incomplete, an aberrant or even someone late enough to start that they don’t need education.
                    <br>
                    <br>Without education, why is the world then turning around? Why does the world have all these complicated systems, all these technologies and all these governments? Why would such comforts exist if not for education?</p>

            <p>Everybody wants to learn as long as he lives. Every child desires to go to school to be 
            able to study, to play with his classmates and to ask help from his teacher. 
            <br>    
            How happy he is every time he receives a star from his teacher whenever he behaves in class. 
            How joyful he feels every time he understands the lesson and be able to interact with the 
            whole class. Who has a heart to deprive what this young being feels? Who has a heart to stop 
            this child from living the life he deserves to have? Anybody who has this kind of heart is a 
            perfect hindrance to an inclusive education.
            <br>
            Yes, inclusive education doesn’t choose, doesn’t pick the best and reject the unfortunate. 
            From the word itself, it includes everyone who has a desire and who has the will to be 
            provided with education. Whether you know everything or not, whether you live a perfect life 
            or not, whether you are rich or poor, whether you are capacitated or not, you are still very 
            much welcome to have the education you always wanted. Everyone is treated fairly, full of just 
            and love. Everybody is guided onto his ups or downs. Nobody stops anyone from learning and being 
            educated the way he wants him to be educated. Everybody receives what is right.</p>
