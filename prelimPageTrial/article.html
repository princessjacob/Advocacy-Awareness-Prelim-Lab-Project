                    <p>Education is as important as making sure of the fact that you are living to this very day. Take the novel Animal Farm by George Orwell for example, wherein the animals had tried their best to be as educated as possible. However, being someone not used to it or being overly naïve enough to simply follow those who are educated made their lives worse for the turn. Their ignorance had led them to only suffer despite the fact that they should have been living in comfort after suffering from slavery for long.
                    <br>
                    <br> A fair proof as to why education is important. A fair proof as to why education should be for all. No one should think that just because someone bests them when it comes to genius that they no longer need education. No one should think that because they are incomplete, an aberrant or even someone late enough to start that they don’t need education.
                    <br>
                    <br>Without education, why is the world then turning around? Why does the world have all these complicated systems, all these technologies and all these governments? Why would such comforts exist if not for education?</p>
