              <h1>What is Inclusive Education?</h1>
              <p>Inclusive Education means that all students with or without disabilities are learning together and they are always welcome to join the school. It is a given to them to feel that they are not different and not feel out of place, it is giving them the life that they want or to live a normal life. Inclusive education also means how the management or staff can handle or teach the students even if they have disabilities or not. They must make the students participate despite their disabilities.</p>
              <br>
              <h1>History of Inclusive Education</h1>
              <p>In 1950, the children with disabilities have the right to receive an education but that time many people believed that they should not learn so it led to the children to go to private education.
              <br>
              <br>
              In 1955, the parents of the children created an organization to gain the right of their children to have education with students who don't have disabilities. Throughout the years, the government realized that the students must have the right to be educated equally with the students without disabilities. They funded the schools and build also schools who offers inclusive education.
