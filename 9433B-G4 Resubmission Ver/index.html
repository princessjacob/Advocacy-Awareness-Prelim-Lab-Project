              <h1>The Advocacy Explained</h1>
              <p>Billions of students from different educational institutions around the world never stop learning each day. Every aspiring individual who believes in the power of education strives hard to study. This is so that he can achieve his goals and ambitions in life and be able to look at himself as someone who steps on the grounds of success.
              <br>
              <br>
              It has been so many years since the Philippines started the practice of inclusive education where everybody and anybody is welcome to be a part of the institution. In the summer capital of the country, Baguio City, a well-known prestigious school welcomes anyone who desires to learn in its four cornered walls. In fact, it even provides quality education which leads to producing graduates who are just and morally upright.
              Inclusive education allows students with disabilities to study in a normal atmosphere in a classroom. It does not exempt anyone from being normal or from living the normal kind of school life. Every student, whether normal or special is given the chance to experience the best kind of education he may ever have. Like every institution, lessons, quizzes, assignments and exams are given to help them nourish their understanding. Teachers make sure of their welfare at the end of the day.
              <br>
              <br>
              This is the kind of education that tries to eradicate discrimination and bullying among students. It helps the society become open to people who are unfortunate of having a life any normal individual has. This is beneficial to everyone because it brings the world to a condition where anyone is free, where nobody stops anybody from living life. In fact, this kind of education values it.</p>
