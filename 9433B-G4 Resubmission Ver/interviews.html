              <h1>How Aspiring Teachers Perceive Inclusive Education</h1>
              <br>
              <p>The following are accroding to Darwin J. Pastor, Khamille T. Emingga and Jeannah Camille M. Dela Paz who are students in the School of Education and Liberal Arts majoring in Special Education whom we interviewed about inclusive education.
      			  <br>
              <br>
              Here are the questions and below are the answers taken from all of them and summarized.
              <br>
              <br>
  			      <b>1. What can you say about inclusive education?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Inclusive education is the so called "Education for all", wherein no child or student is excluded from being a part of the school. Inclusive education aims to give not equal but fair opportunities for children to learn and interact with their peers despite of their limitations. The purpose of inclusive education is basically to eradicate prejudice, discrimination and differences among children with or without disability. As long as students accept each other, they will live harmoniously despite a little diversity.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>2. What are the good things that a teacher can do in an inclusive education?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
        			The teacher can give proper accommodations and modifications in the classroom if needed so that the student will be able to catch up with the lesson without lessening the quality of what is learnt.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>3. How can the inclusive school provide the needs of different learners with different abilities?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
        			In status quo, there is an institute for inclusive education where children who have the following disabilities are catered: visual impairment, hearing impairment and others.  Every child who has a special need is catered accordingly. For instance a child who has a visual impairment may learn through instructional materials like braille. A child who has hearing impairment may learn through brochures that contains more pictures than words to be able to satisfy learning through vision rather than hearing. The inclusive school can also build ramps for the students who are physically challenged and exclusive comfort rooms meant for the said students. Also, modification of the curriculum, accommodation and if the
        			teacher is creative enough they can offer interventions for the child.
              <br>
              <br>
        			<b>4. In a class how can the teacher meet the needs of the different learners? and how can the teacher conduct
        			activities in such a way that students with different abilities can participate?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
        			A teacher is a big factor to students in their learning. What teachers can do to make an inclusive education
        			effective is that they should observe the students for them to know and discover what their needs are. Also,
        			they must perform an initial assessment to those children in order to test and identify what needs to be focused on and modify the curriculum to fit the students. Teachers must walk the talk and practice what they teach. They should serve as role models to the young ones.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>5. Can you say that inclusive education is better than exclusive education?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
        			Yes, because it's purpose is to provides every child to participate in school despite of their disabilities. They can learn, it is just that their level is not the same as the other children.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>6. What makes a bad teacher? What makes a good teacher?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
        			Every teacher wants the best for his student just like a mother who wants the best for her child. There is no such thing called a bad teacher. Maybe the teacher is not performing well in class that’s why he may be called as someone who is irresponsible rather than bad. Sometimes teachers come to class unprepared and it
        			is a mortal sin in the field of education. As they say if an engineer fails to construct a building, he kills humanity but if a teacher teachers wrong information to the students he kills the whole civilization. A good teacher is someone who teaches from the heart and influences the mindset of the students. Teachers who teach values in life is more significant than teachers who just teach lessons and who just care about the syllabus provided. Students may be the best in class because of what teachers ask
        			them to memorize. However, students who listen from the heart of the teachers who teach with love are still better and really molded to become who they deserve to be in this world. Teachers who make their students apply the learnings outside the four walls of the classroom are the ones who are said to be effective and
        			efficient. It’s what the world needs, teachers who care about students’ welfare.
              <br>
              <br>
        			<b>7. Give ways to help reduce bullying.</b>
              <br>
              <br>
        			Aside from teacher factor, classmates and schoolmates may also become factors in the learning of students who need special attention and care. It is undeniable that different schools in town still encounter bullying and discrimination among students especially in an institution where students with disabilities
        			exist. But as a continuing efficient kind of education, inclusive education tries to reduce these circumstances by implementing activities especially on the first day of class. Students get to know each other by introducing themselves and letting them share and explain who they really are, that despite the differences they have, they still possess common characteristics that’s why they may belong in the same class and atmosphere. But nevertheless, it’s not the whole responsibility of students to let their
        			classmates understand them. The teachers are solely responsible for controlling the class and maintaining a good relationship with every student in the class.
