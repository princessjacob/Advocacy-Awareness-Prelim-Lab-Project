        <h3>About My Life...</h3>
             <br><br>
        <div id = "content">
        <p> Greetings everyone! My name is Juan Miguel T. Ramirez. I am 20 years old and my birthdate is on December 10. I am chubby and awesome! I am talkative and making other people laugh too. We are four in our family and we have a dog named Pam which is also included to our family hehe. My family is the best because eventhough they don't tell I can already see that they really love me that bad. Especially my brother when he's at work my mom always call my brother to ask how is he doing. I am currently enrolled to Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, third year. Probably going to finish this course as soon as possible hehe. Well I'm not in a rush. I think we all have our own insights of our own motiviation in life. I know we fail  sometimes and I am confident that Sky's the limit. I was born to finish what I've started. You can have what you want be want you want. </p>

            <br><br>
            <p> First of, my real hobby is to eat ☺. Next, is to taking photo's especially my close friends which I really love to do everyday. I also love video and photo editing especially after photoshoot/videoshoot. My hobby is also playing computer games and playing basketball. Me and my dad sometimes go out and jog around the corner or riding a bike with him too. My family loves games so sometimes we play through online or local area network games. I love this subject because I love making website because my dream is also to create a website full of my shots and videos. I also love layouting like modding cars in the game of GTA V and designing stuffs like maybe shirts or cap and cars in real life.

     <h3>College Life...</h3>
             <br><br>
        <p>Here in college life, I experienced the most difficult consequences in my life which I encountered especially in my third year. It's like a hell year for us too but after the first semester it was kinda self relaxing to us. When I was in first year, it was kinda hard for me because my blockmates left me in SLU, they all transferred to other schools because they can't take the hardships anymore. Now, I always keep telling myself that I will make my parents proud soon and pay them back after when I already have work. I know it's a life test for us because after graduating I will find a job that best suits for me which maybe a web developer and I always kept saying that I will be a successful person. Through ups & downs thanks to my friends that became a family to me too.
