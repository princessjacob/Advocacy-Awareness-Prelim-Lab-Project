                        A <i>prisoner</i>, the princess' jailmate is someone who had been in prison twice. A man who spouts pure sarcasm and acts like some sort of hero. But behind him is a shadow of someone who's once an innocent child.

                        A <i>young warden</i>, someone who bears a pure talent of manipulation but disliked it in many ways. A sarcastic young man who stood on steel beliefs. He likes to think that he's saving people but is he really?

                        <p>I have other unfinished products or simply ongoing material. But at the moment, I only shared what's done. These pieces are mostly what I worked on during semester breaks. I create them simply so that I can accomplish something during breaks. They're fun to make and this is where I usually make use of programming, minimal as it is.</p>
